First of all, welcome!

This blog was created at the beginning of 2025.
I’ve never quite gotten along with social media algorithms. The way information is presented doesn’t give the depth I would like to connect with friends I value ( that means youuuu). 

So, I built this digital space as a middle ground to organize my thoughts and connect with friends. You’re always welcome to send me an email if something on these pages catches your interest,sharing thoughts or simply want to share pictures of your dog or cat.

I’m still considering whether to add a comment section, but for now, I think I’ll leave things as they are.
