Lucy Punker Zhang was born in Het Wilde Weg, Sint-Oedenrode, The Netherlands.  We met eachother during the residency HopePunk: Reknitting Collective Infrastructures of Hackers & Designers in 2023. She is one of the best climbers I've ever known. she is very focused on her catsonal growth and only enjoys eating mass-produced cat food. This page is for her.
