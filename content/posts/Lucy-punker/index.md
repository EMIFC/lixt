Lucy Punker was born in Het Wilde Weg, Sint-Oedenrode, The Netherlands. We met each other during the residency HopePunk: Reknitting Collective Infrastructures of Hackers & Designers in 2023. She named by her pervious family, and her family name is in memory of the residency HopePunk. She has a sister name Laura and a uncle named Harry. Her mother was a bit shy, so I didn't speak to her much, and her father seemed to be missing. She is one of the best climbers I've ever known. she is clam and smart, highly focusing on her catsonal growth and only enjoys eating mass-produced cat food. This page is for her.
