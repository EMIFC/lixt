The begining of 2025, I went to a meditation retreat in a Thai temple in Lede, Belguim. There are thoghts during the trip.

Today, during the wisdom talk, the monk said meditation can help rid us of greed and angerâ€”things that make us feel disconnected and lead to suffering. I asked if we can truly get rid of the things that make us suffer, given that they are just expressions of a deeper fear within everyone. We can remove those expressions, but it seems like the deep fear remains, and it will comes over and over again. Is practice still effective?
He admitted he actually didn't know the answer, but he also said: Thought comes from another thought, its beginning is just from one thought. I think this has already answers all.

There is also the first time I spoke with both European and Thai monk and stayed in a Thai Buddhist temple. I like the way Thai buddhism emphasizes meditation-it feels like it is more focus on encouraging people to follow the path of becoming an arhat. At the same time, I dislike the structure of only men can become monks, if a woman would like to contribute, then she can only do so by serving voluntary work. Monks are the people who can enjoy their meditation and waiting women to serve them food and money everyday. At this point.  I can only see power dynamic at the play. 

I also notice differences between European monks and Thai monks,I felt more peace when talking to Thai monks, those peace was come from their determination something I found lacking in the my conversation with the European monks. They seems like they could quit whenever they want to.

In general, it was a nice trip, I felt some plants inside me after this, not sure how will them grow.
