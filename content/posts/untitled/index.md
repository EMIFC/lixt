We walked in a private garden, the green moss on the path has the color like I can only find in a painting. They grew in a way of hugging, even though they are individual units, but they seem like an organism, so real and connected. River and I kept walking until we saw two divided straight paths in front of us. We chose the right-side one and biked forward, this path is very well planned, those organized wood at the side to create the division, it looks never-ending and continues to the edge of the planet until we can touch the sky. Then we had a turn, we see a tree in a piece of big grass, standing in their own realm. Those pink and white flowers slowly flew down around it, just like a white rounded carpet.

We spent time with this tree, looked at the moss and small leaves growing on their branches, the lights on the small leaves, shining on its hairy edges. Golden hour. I couldn’t help but doubt that if I’m in real life or a blip of a dream. River said, maybe it doesn’t matter. This is the first time I don’t feel sad when I see things are beauty. Things which are too beautiful make me feel weak and scared, my mind reminded me always about losing them, they just like a glass which I valued but I knew it’ll break in a certain moment, it won’t last long. When River next to me, these sadness didn’t come. All things in front of me are so gentle, they’re not gentle in a ‘way’, not in a ‘form’, they’re gentle themself. 

We tried to write a poem, but we couldn’t make it, the weightlessness in my mind, no word I could think of. We slowly moved after a goodbye. This weightlessness is a gift, it is not embodied by a moment of huge happiness, it just grounded and settled, I know it is the thing which will last long and keep me whole.
